<!-- Getting into art was something that was very daunting to me before I finally took the plunge. I have no classical training, and never really thought I could consider myself an "artist". Then one day I went to the MoMA in San Francisco, and for the first time I felt inspired to art in the ways that I was able to, and felt no shame for where I was at in my own artistic journey. Seeing all of the different ways that art can exist through so many different mediums and skill types inspired me to explore the art in my own heart.

Art is about an artist and a message. It doesn't matter how you decide to portray that message, even if it is finger painting and stick figures: if you are able to relay a message to others through ANY medium, you are able to make art. Terence Mckenna said "we have to create culture", and creating art is creating culture. Being human means we get to consume and create, but I think that if you try to create more than you consume then you are doing your part - plus, a lot of self learning and self growing manifests in the creation of art.
