I have been working on different ways to practice algorithms. 
One way that I have been practicing is by predicting the console's output of different JavaScript algorithms.

{% highlight javascript %}
console.log ("QUESTION 1");
for(var i=0; i<5;i++){   
   console.log(i);
}
{% endhighlight %}

OUTPUT:

{% highlight %}
0
1
2
3
4
{%end highlight%}
